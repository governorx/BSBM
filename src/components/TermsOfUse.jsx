           <h1>WELCOME TO BlueMarket</h1><br/>
            <p> We (BlueMarket, Inc.) hope you find it useful. By accessing or otherwise interacting with our servers, services, websites, 
                mobile app ("App"), or any associated content/postings (together, "BL"), you agree to these Terms of Use ("TOU") (last updated November 11, 2019). 
                You acknowledge and agree that BL is a private site owned and operated by BlueMarket, Inc. If you are accessing or using BL on behalf of a business, 
                you represent and warrant to BL that you have authority to accept the "TOU" on behalf of that business and that business agrees to the "TOU". 
                If you do not agree to the "TOU", you are not authorized to use BL or download the App. We may modify the "TOU" at any time at our sole discretion. 
                You are responsible for periodically checking for changes and are bound by them if you continue to use BL. Our privacy policy 
                (bluemarket.com/about/privacy.policy), prohibited list (bluemarket.com/about/prohibited), and all other policies, site rules, and agreements referenced 
                below or on BL, are fully incorporated into this "TOU", and you agree to them as well.</p>
            
            <h2>LICENSE</h2><br/>
            <p> If you agree to the "TOU" and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to use BL and be bound by the "TOU", or (2) use BL on behalf of a business, 
                thereby binding that business to the "TOU", we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use BL in compliance with 
                the "TOU"; unlicensed use is unauthorized. You agree not to display, "frame," make derivative works, distribute, license, or sell, content from BL, 
                excluding postings you create. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, display, 
                distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.</p>
            
            <h2>USE</h2><br/>
            <p>Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree not to use or provide software (except our App and general purpose web 
                browsers and email clients) or services that interact or interoperate with BL, e.g. for downloading, uploading, creating/accessing/using an account, 
                posting, flagging, emailing, searching, or mobile use. You agree not to copy/collect BL content via robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or 
                any automated or manual equivalent (e.g., by hand). Misleading, unsolicited, and/or unlawful postings/communications/accounts are prohibited, as is 
                buying or selling accounts. You agree not to post content that is prohibited by any of BL's policies or rules referenced above ("Prohibited Content"). 
                You agree not to abuse BL's flagging or reporting processes. You agree not to collect BL user information or interfere with BL. You agree we may moderate 
                BL access/use in our sole discretion, e.g., by blocking, filtering, re-categorizing, re-ranking, deleting, delaying, holding, omitting, verifying, or 
                terminating your access/license/account. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing
                we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not. Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree not to (i) rent, lease, 
                sell, publish, distribute, license, sublicense, assign, transfer, or otherwise make available BL or our application programming interface ("API"), (ii) copy, 
                adapt, create derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, translate, localize, port or modify the App, the API, any website code, or any software used 
                to provide BL, (iii) combine or integrate BL or the API with any software, technology, services, or materials not authorized by us, (iv) circumvent any 
                functionality that controls access to or otherwise protects BL or the API, or (v) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices. 
                You agree not to use BL or the API in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property rights or 
                other rights of any person, or that violates any applicable law.</p>
                 
            <h2>LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</h2><br/>
            <p>You further agree that if you violate the "TOU", or you encourage, support, benefit from, or induce others to do so, you will be jointly and severally 
                liable to us for liquidated damages as follows:
            (A) collecting/harvesting BL users' information, including personal or identifying information - $5 per violation; 
            (B) publishing/misusing personal or identifying information of a third party in connection with your use of BL without that party's express written consent - $2,000 per violation; 
            (C) misrepresenting your identity or affiliation to anyone in connection with your use of BL - $2,000 per violation; 
            (D) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content - $5 per violation; 
            (E) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content in any paid section of BL - the price per post applicable to that section of BL; 
            (F) sending an unauthorized/unsolicited email to an email address obtained from BL - $25 per violation; 
            (G) using BL user information to make/send an unauthorized/unsolicited text message, call, or communication to a BL user - $500 per text/call/communication; 
            (H) creating a misleading or unlawful BL account or buying/selling a BL account - $4 per violation; 
            (I) abusing or attempting to abuse BL's flagging or reporting processes - $1 per violation; 
            (J) distributing any software to facilitate violations of the USE Section - $1,000 per violation; 
            (K) aggregating, displaying, framing, copying, duplicating, reproducing, making derivative works from, distributing, licensing, selling, or exploiting BL content for any purpose without our express written consent - $3,000 for each day you engage in such violations; 
            (L) requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000 pages of BL in any 24-hour period - $0.25 per page during the 24 hour period after the first 1,000 pages; 
            (M) bypassing or attempting to bypass our moderation efforts - $4 per violation. You agree that these amounts are (1) a reasonable estimate of our damages (as actual damages are often difficult to calculate), (2) not a penalty, and (3) not otherwise limiting our ability to recover under any legal theory or claim, including statutory damages and other equitable relief (e.g., for spam, we can elect between the above liquidated damages or statutory damages under the anti-spam statute). You further agree that repeated violations of the USE section will irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages.</p>

            <h2>DISCLAIMER & LIABILITY</h2><br/>
            <p>To the full extent permitted by law, BlueMarket, Inc., and its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, affiliates, and successors in interest 
            ("BL Entities") (1) make no promises, warranties, or representations as to BL, including its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security 
            or reliability; (2) provide BL on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis and any risk of using BL is assumed by you; (3) disclaim all warranties, express or implied, 
            including as to accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and all warranties arising from a course of dealing, usage, or 
            trade practice; and (4) disclaim any liability or responsibility for acts, omissions, or conduct of you or any party in connection with BL. BL Entities are NOT 
            liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or other losses, including lost profits, revenues, data, goodwill, etc., arising 
            from or related to BL, and in no event shall such liability exceed $100 or the amount you paid us in the year preceding such loss. Some jurisdictions restrict or 
            alter these disclaimers and limits, so some may not apply to you. </p>

            <h2>CLAIMS & INDEMNITY</h2><br/> 
            <p>Any claim, cause of action, demand, or dispute arising from or related to BL ("Claims") will be governed by the internal laws of Virginia, without regard 
            to conflict of law provisions, except to the extent governed by US federal law. Any Claims will be exclusively resolved by courts in Hampton, VA (except we may 
            seek preliminary or injunctive relief anywhere). You agree to (1) submit to the personal jurisdiction of courts in Hampton, VA; (2) indemnify and hold BL Entities 
            harmless from any Claims, losses, liability, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) that arise from a third party and relate to your use of BL; and (3) be liable
            and responsible for any Claims we may have against your officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, or any other party, directly or indirectly, paid, 
            directed or controlled by you, or acting for your benefit.</p>

            <h2>TRADEMARKS</h2><br/>
            <p>BlueMarket, "BL" and the cart symbol logo are registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with multiple trademark offices around 
            the world.</p>

            <h2>MISC.</h2><br/>
            <p> Unless you have entered into a separate written or electronic agreement with us that expressly references the "TOU", this is the exclusive and entire 
                agreement between us and you, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written 
                and oral. Users complying with prior written licenses may access BL thereby until authorization is terminated. Our actions or silence toward you or 
                anyone else does not waive, modify, or limit the "TOU" or our ability to enforce it. The USE, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, CLAIMS & INDEMNITY sections survive 
                termination of the "TOU", and you will remain bound by those sections. If a "TOU" term is unenforceable, it shall be limited to the least extent possible
                and supplemented with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of the parties. </p>
